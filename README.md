    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      DinoGPT is an AI-powered application created during the 4/6/24 Hackathon by Team LiquidDeath. It utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3 model to generate text-based responses based on user input. The application features interactive 3D dinosaur animations built with React and @react-three/fiber, providing users with a fun and engaging experience.
    </p>
    <h3>Inspiration</h3>
    <p>
      Our inspiration for DinoGPT came from our fascination with both artificial intelligence and dinosaurs. We wanted to create a project that merges these interests into a unique and entertaining experience for users.
    </p>
    <h3>What it does</h3>
    <p>
      DinoGPT allows users to input prompts or questions, and it generates creative and contextually relevant responses using AI. The application also showcases dynamic 3D dinosaur animations that respond to user interactions, enhancing the overall user experience.
    </p>
    <h3>How we built it</h3>
    <p>
      We built DinoGPT using Next.js for the frontend, integrating with OpenAI's GPT-3 model for natural language processing. The 3D animations were created with @react-three/fiber, providing smooth and interactive visuals.
